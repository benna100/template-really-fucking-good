## Easter Eggs
As a little added bonus, if you load the game on a modern smartphone (iOS 4.2.1+, Android 4.0.3+) you can shake the phone to reset the application. After a while the cellular automation tends to reach a stable state so this is a way to disrupt it. Alternatively you can resize the screen or reload the page. To detect motion [shake.js](https://github.com/alexgibson/shake.js/) was used.
